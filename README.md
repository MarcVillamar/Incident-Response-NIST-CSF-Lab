### Objective

In this lab, I mimic incident response to a DDoS cyber attack to a marketing firm. The main objective is to respond to the attack according to the NIST CSF - Identify, Detect, Protect, Respond, Recover.

### Skills Learned

- Respond to a DDoS cyber attack based on the NIST CSF.
- Identify the five stages of the CSF and apply it to the given DDoS attack.
- Apply each stage to the scenario to get answers on how the attack occured.
- Understand how the NIST CSF can be applied for Incident Respond.
- Develop a report addressing the root cause, how it was identified and how in the future a DDoS attack can be prevented.
- Use critical thinking and problem-solving skills to complete the activity using the entire lifecycle of the NIST CSF.

### Tools Used

- NIST CSF documentation to better understand each stage, and how it can be applied to any situation from begining to end.

- First evaluate the given scenario, and understand the DDoS attack and get all the details surrounding the attack.

- Second evaluate the NIST CSF and how it is applied. This allows me to begin formulating how I can apply it to the given DDoS attack scenario.

- Third is to actually apply the NIST CSF to incident response, in this case applied to the DDoD attack that took place.
